0,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
1,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
2,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
3,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
4,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
5,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
6,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
7,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
8,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
9,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
10,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
11,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
12,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
13,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
14,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
15,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
16,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
17,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
18,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
19,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
20,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
21,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
22,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
23,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
24,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
25,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
26,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
27,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
28,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
29,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
30,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
31,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
32,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
33,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
34,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
35,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
36,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
37,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
38,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
39,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
40,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
41,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
42,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
43,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
44,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
45,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
46,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
47,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
48,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
49,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
50,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
51,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
52,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
53,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
54,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
55,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
56,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
57,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
58,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
59,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
60,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
61,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
62,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
63,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
64,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
65,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
66,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
67,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
68,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
69,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
70,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
71,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
72,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
73,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
74,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
75,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
76,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
77,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
78,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
79,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
80,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
81,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
82,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
83,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
84,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
85,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
86,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
87,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
88,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
89,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
90,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
91,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
92,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
93,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
94,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
95,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
96,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
97,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
98,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
99,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
100,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
101,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
102,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
103,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
104,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
105,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
106,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
107,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
108,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
109,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
110,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
111,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
112,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
113,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
114,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
115,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
116,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
117,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
118,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
119,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
120,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
121,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
122,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
123,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
124,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
125,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
126,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
127,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
128,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
129,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
130,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
131,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
132,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
133,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
134,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
135,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
136,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
137,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
138,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
139,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
140,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
141,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
142,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
143,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
144,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
145,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
146,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
147,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
148,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
149,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
150,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
151,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
152,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
153,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
154,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
155,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
156,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
157,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
158,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
159,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
160,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
161,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
162,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
163,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
164,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
165,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
166,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
167,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
168,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
169,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
170,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
171,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
172,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
173,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
174,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
175,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
176,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
177,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
178,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
179,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
180,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
181,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
182,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
183,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
184,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
185,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
186,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
187,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
188,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
189,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
190,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
191,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
192,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
193,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
194,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
195,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
196,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
197,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
198,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
199,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
200,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
201,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
202,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
203,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
204,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
205,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
206,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
207,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
208,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
209,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
210,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
211,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
212,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
213,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
214,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
215,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
216,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
217,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
218,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
219,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
220,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
221,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
222,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
223,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
224,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
225,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
226,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
227,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
228,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
229,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
230,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
231,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
232,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
233,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
234,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
235,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
236,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
237,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
238,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
239,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
240,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
241,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
242,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
243,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
244,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
245,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
246,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
247,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
248,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
249,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
250,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
251,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
252,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
253,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
254,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
255,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
256,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
257,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
258,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
259,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
260,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
261,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
262,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
263,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
264,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
265,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
266,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
267,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
268,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
269,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
270,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
271,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
272,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
273,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
274,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
275,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
276,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
277,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
278,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
279,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
280,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
281,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
282,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
283,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
284,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
285,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
286,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
287,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
288,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
289,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
290,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
291,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
292,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
293,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
294,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
295,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
296,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
297,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
298,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
299,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
300,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
301,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
302,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
303,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
304,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
305,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
306,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
307,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
308,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
309,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
310,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
311,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
312,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
313,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
314,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
315,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
316,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
317,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
318,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
319,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
320,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
321,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
322,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
323,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
324,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
325,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
326,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
327,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
328,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
329,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
330,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
331,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
332,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
333,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
334,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
335,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
336,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
337,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
338,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
339,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
340,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
341,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
342,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
343,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
344,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
345,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
346,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
347,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
348,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
349,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
350,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
351,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
352,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
353,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
354,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
355,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
356,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
357,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
358,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
359,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
360,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
361,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
362,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
363,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
364,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
365,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
366,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
367,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
368,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
369,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
370,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
371,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
372,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
373,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
374,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
375,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
376,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
377,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
378,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
379,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
380,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
381,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
382,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
383,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
384,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
385,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
386,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
387,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
388,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
389,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
390,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
391,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
392,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
393,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
394,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
395,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
396,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
397,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
398,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
399,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
400,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
401,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
402,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
403,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
404,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
405,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
406,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
407,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
408,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
409,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
410,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
411,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
412,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
413,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
414,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
415,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
416,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
417,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
418,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
419,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
420,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
421,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
422,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
423,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
424,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
425,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
426,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
427,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
428,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
429,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
430,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
431,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
432,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
433,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
434,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
435,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
436,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
437,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
438,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
439,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
440,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
441,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
442,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
443,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
444,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
445,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
446,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
447,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
448,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
449,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
450,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
451,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
452,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
453,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
454,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
455,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
456,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
457,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
458,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
459,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
460,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
461,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
462,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
463,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
464,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
465,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
466,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
467,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
468,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
469,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
470,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
471,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
472,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
473,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
474,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
475,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
476,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
477,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
478,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
479,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
480,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
481,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
482,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
483,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
484,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
485,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
486,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
487,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
488,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
489,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
490,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
491,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
492,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
493,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
494,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
495,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
496,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
497,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
498,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
499,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
500,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
501,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
502,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
503,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
504,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
505,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
506,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
507,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
508,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
509,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
510,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
511,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
512,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
513,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
514,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
515,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
516,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
517,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
518,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
519,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
520,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
521,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
522,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
523,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
524,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
525,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
526,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
527,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
528,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
529,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
530,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
531,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
532,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
533,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
534,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
535,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
536,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
537,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
538,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
539,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
540,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
541,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
542,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
543,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
544,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
545,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
546,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
547,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
548,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
549,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
550,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
551,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
552,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
553,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
554,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
555,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
556,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
557,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
558,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
559,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
560,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
561,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
562,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
563,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
564,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
565,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
566,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
567,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
568,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
569,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
570,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
571,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
572,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
573,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
574,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
575,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
576,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
577,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
578,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
579,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
580,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
581,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
582,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
583,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
584,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
585,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
586,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
587,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
588,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
589,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
590,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
591,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
592,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
593,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
594,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
595,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
596,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
597,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
598,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
599,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
600,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
601,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
602,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
603,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
604,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
605,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
606,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
607,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
608,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
609,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
610,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
611,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
612,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
613,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
614,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
615,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
616,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
617,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
618,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
619,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
620,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
621,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
622,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
623,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
624,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
625,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
626,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
627,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
628,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
629,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
630,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
631,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
632,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
633,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
634,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
635,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
636,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
637,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
638,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
639,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
640,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
641,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
642,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
643,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
644,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
645,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
646,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
647,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
648,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
649,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
650,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
651,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
652,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
653,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
654,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
655,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
656,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
657,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
658,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
659,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
660,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
661,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
662,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
663,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
664,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
665,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
666,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
667,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
668,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
669,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
670,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
671,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
672,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
673,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
674,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
675,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
676,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
677,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
678,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
679,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
680,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
681,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
682,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
683,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
684,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
685,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
686,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
687,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
688,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
689,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
690,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
691,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
692,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
693,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
694,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
695,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
696,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
697,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
698,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
699,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
700,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
701,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
702,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
703,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
704,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
705,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
706,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
707,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
708,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
709,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
710,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
711,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
712,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
713,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
714,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
715,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
716,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
717,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
718,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
719,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
720,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
721,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
722,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
723,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
724,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
725,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
726,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
727,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
728,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
729,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
730,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
731,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
732,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
733,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
734,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
735,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
736,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
737,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
738,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
739,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
740,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
741,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
742,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
743,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
744,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
745,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
746,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
747,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
748,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
749,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
750,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
751,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
752,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
753,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
754,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
755,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
756,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
757,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
758,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
759,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
760,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
761,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
762,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
763,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
764,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
765,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
766,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
767,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
768,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
769,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
770,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
771,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
772,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
773,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
774,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
775,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
776,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
777,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
778,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
779,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
780,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
781,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
782,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
783,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
784,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
785,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
786,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
787,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
788,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
789,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
790,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
791,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
792,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
793,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
794,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
795,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
796,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
797,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
798,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
799,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
800,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
801,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
802,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
803,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
804,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
805,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
806,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
807,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
808,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
809,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
810,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
811,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
812,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
813,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
814,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
815,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
816,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
817,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
818,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
819,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
820,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
821,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
822,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
823,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
824,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
825,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
826,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
827,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
828,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
829,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
830,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
831,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
832,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
833,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
834,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
835,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
836,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
837,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
838,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
839,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
840,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
841,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
842,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
843,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
844,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
845,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
846,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
847,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
848,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
849,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
850,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
851,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
852,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
853,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
854,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
855,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
856,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
857,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
858,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
859,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
860,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
861,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
862,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
863,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
864,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
865,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
866,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
867,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
868,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
869,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
870,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
871,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
872,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
873,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
874,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
875,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
876,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
877,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
878,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
879,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
880,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
881,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
882,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
883,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
884,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
885,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
886,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
887,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
888,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
889,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
890,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
891,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
892,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
893,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
894,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
895,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
896,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
897,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
898,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
899,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
900,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
901,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
902,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
903,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
904,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
905,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
906,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
907,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
908,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
909,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
910,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
911,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
912,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
913,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
914,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
915,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
916,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
917,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
918,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
919,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
920,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
921,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
922,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
923,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
924,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
925,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
926,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
927,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
928,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
929,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
930,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
931,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
932,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
933,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
934,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
935,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
936,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
937,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
938,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
939,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
940,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
941,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
942,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
943,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
944,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
945,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
946,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
947,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
948,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
949,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
950,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
951,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
952,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
953,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
954,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
955,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
956,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
957,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
958,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
959,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
960,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
961,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
962,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
963,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
964,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
965,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
966,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
967,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
968,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
969,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
970,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
971,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
972,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
973,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
974,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
975,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
976,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
977,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
978,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
979,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
980,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
981,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
982,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
983,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
984,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
985,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
986,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
987,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
988,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
989,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
990,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
991,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
992,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
993,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
994,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
995,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
996,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
997,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
998,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
999,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
1000,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
1001,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
1002,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
1003,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
1004,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
1005,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
1006,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
1007,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
1008,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
1009,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
1010,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
1011,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
1012,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
1013,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
1014,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
1015,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
1016,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
1017,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
1018,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
1019,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
1020,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
1021,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
1022,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
1023,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
1024,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
1025,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
1026,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
1027,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
1028,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
1029,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
1030,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
1031,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
1032,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
1033,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
1034,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
1035,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
1036,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
1037,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
1038,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
1039,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
1040,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
1041,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
1042,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
1043,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
1044,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
1045,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
1046,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
1047,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
1048,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
1049,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
1050,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
1051,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
1052,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
1053,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
1054,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
1055,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
1056,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
1057,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
1058,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
1059,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
1060,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
1061,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
1062,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
1063,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
1064,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
1065,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
1066,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
1067,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
1068,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
1069,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
1070,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
1071,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
1072,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
1073,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
1074,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
1075,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
1076,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
1077,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
1078,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
1079,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
1080,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
1081,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
1082,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
1083,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
1084,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
1085,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
1086,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
1087,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
1088,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
1089,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
1090,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
1091,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
1092,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
1093,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
1094,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
1095,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
1096,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
1097,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
1098,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
1099,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
1100,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
1101,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
1102,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
1103,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
1104,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
1105,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
1106,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
1107,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
1108,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
1109,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
1110,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
1111,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
1112,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
1113,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
1114,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
1115,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
1116,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
1117,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
1118,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
1119,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
1120,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
1121,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
1122,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
1123,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
1124,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
1125,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
1126,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
1127,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
1128,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
1129,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
1130,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
1131,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
1132,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
1133,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
1134,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
1135,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
1136,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
1137,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
1138,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
1139,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
1140,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
1141,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
1142,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
1143,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
1144,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
1145,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
1146,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
1147,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
1148,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
1149,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
1150,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
1151,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
1152,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
1153,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
1154,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
1155,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
1156,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
1157,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
1158,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
1159,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
1160,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
1161,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
1162,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
1163,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
1164,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
1165,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
1166,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
1167,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
1168,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
1169,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
1170,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
1171,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
1172,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
1173,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
1174,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
1175,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
1176,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
1177,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
1178,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
1179,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
1180,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
1181,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
1182,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
1183,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
1184,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
1185,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
1186,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
1187,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
1188,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
1189,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
1190,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
1191,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
1192,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
1193,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
1194,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
1195,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
1196,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
1197,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
1198,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
1199,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
1200,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
1201,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
1202,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
1203,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
1204,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
1205,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
1206,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
1207,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
1208,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
1209,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
1210,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
1211,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
1212,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
1213,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
1214,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
1215,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
1216,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
1217,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
1218,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
1219,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
1220,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
1221,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
1222,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
1223,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
1224,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
1225,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
1226,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
1227,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
1228,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
1229,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
1230,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
1231,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
1232,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
1233,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
1234,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
1235,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
1236,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
1237,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
1238,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
1239,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
1240,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
1241,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
1242,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
1243,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
1244,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
1245,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
1246,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
1247,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
1248,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
1249,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
1250,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
1251,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
1252,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
1253,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
1254,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
1255,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
1256,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
1257,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
1258,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
1259,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
1260,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
1261,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
1262,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
1263,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
1264,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
1265,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
1266,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
1267,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
1268,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
1269,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
1270,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
1271,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
1272,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
1273,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
1274,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
1275,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
1276,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
1277,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
1278,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
1279,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
1280,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
1281,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
1282,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
1283,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
1284,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
1285,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
1286,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
1287,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
1288,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
1289,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
1290,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
1291,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
1292,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
1293,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
1294,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
1295,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
1296,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
1297,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
1298,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
1299,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
1300,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
1301,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
1302,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
1303,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
1304,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
1305,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
1306,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
1307,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
1308,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
1309,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
1310,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
1311,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
1312,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
1313,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
1314,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
1315,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
1316,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
1317,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
1318,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
1319,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
1320,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
1321,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
1322,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
1323,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
1324,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
1325,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
1326,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
1327,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
1328,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
1329,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
1330,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
1331,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
1332,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
1333,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
1334,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
1335,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
1336,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
1337,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
1338,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
1339,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
1340,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
1341,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
1342,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
1343,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
1344,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
1345,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
1346,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
1347,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
1348,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
1349,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
1350,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
1351,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
1352,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
1353,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
1354,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
1355,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
1356,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
1357,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
1358,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
1359,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
1360,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
1361,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
1362,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
1363,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
1364,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
1365,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
1366,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
1367,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
1368,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
1369,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
1370,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
1371,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
1372,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
1373,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
1374,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
1375,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
1376,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
1377,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
1378,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
1379,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
1380,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
1381,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
1382,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
1383,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
1384,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
1385,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
1386,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
1387,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
1388,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
1389,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
1390,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
1391,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
1392,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
1393,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
1394,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
1395,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
1396,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
1397,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
1398,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
1399,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
1400,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
1401,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
1402,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
1403,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
1404,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
1405,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
1406,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
1407,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
1408,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
1409,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
1410,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
1411,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
1412,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
1413,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
1414,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
1415,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
1416,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
1417,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
1418,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
1419,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
1420,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
1421,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
1422,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
1423,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
1424,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
1425,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
1426,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
1427,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
1428,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
1429,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
1430,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
1431,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
1432,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
1433,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
1434,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
1435,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
1436,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
1437,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
1438,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
1439,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
1440,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
1441,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
1442,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
1443,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
1444,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
1445,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
1446,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
1447,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
1448,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
1449,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
1450,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
1451,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
1452,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
1453,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
1454,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
1455,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
1456,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
1457,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
1458,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
1459,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
1460,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
1461,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
1462,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
1463,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
1464,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
1465,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
1466,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
1467,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
1468,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
1469,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
1470,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
1471,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
1472,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
1473,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
1474,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
1475,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
1476,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
1477,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
1478,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
1479,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
1480,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
1481,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
1482,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
1483,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
1484,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
1485,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
1486,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
1487,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
1488,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
1489,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
1490,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
1491,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
1492,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
1493,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
1494,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
1495,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
1496,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
1497,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
1498,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
1499,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
1500,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
1501,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
1502,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
1503,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
1504,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
1505,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
1506,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
1507,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
1508,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
1509,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
1510,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
1511,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
1512,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
1513,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
1514,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
1515,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
1516,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
1517,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
1518,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
1519,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
1520,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
1521,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
1522,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
1523,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
1524,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
1525,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
1526,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
1527,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
1528,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
1529,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
1530,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
1531,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
1532,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
1533,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
1534,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
1535,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
1536,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
1537,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
1538,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
1539,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
1540,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
1541,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
1542,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
1543,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
1544,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
1545,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
1546,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
1547,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
1548,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
1549,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
1550,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
1551,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
1552,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
1553,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
1554,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
1555,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
1556,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
1557,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
1558,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
1559,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
1560,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
1561,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
1562,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
1563,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
1564,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
1565,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
1566,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
1567,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
1568,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
1569,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
1570,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
1571,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
1572,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
1573,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
1574,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
1575,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
1576,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
1577,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
1578,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
1579,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
1580,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
1581,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
1582,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
1583,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
1584,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
1585,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
1586,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
1587,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
1588,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
1589,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
1590,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
1591,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
1592,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
1593,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
1594,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
1595,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
1596,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
1597,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
1598,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
1599,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
1600,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
1601,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
1602,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
1603,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
1604,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
1605,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
1606,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
1607,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
1608,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
1609,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
1610,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
1611,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
1612,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
1613,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
1614,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
1615,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
1616,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
1617,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
1618,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
1619,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
1620,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
1621,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
1622,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
1623,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
1624,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
1625,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
1626,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
1627,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
1628,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
1629,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
1630,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
1631,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
1632,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
1633,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
1634,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
1635,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
1636,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
1637,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
1638,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
1639,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
1640,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
1641,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
1642,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
1643,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
1644,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
1645,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
1646,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
1647,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
1648,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
1649,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
1650,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
1651,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
1652,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
1653,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
1654,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
1655,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
1656,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
1657,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
1658,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
1659,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
1660,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
1661,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
1662,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
1663,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
1664,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
1665,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
1666,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
1667,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
1668,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
1669,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
1670,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
1671,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
1672,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
1673,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
1674,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
1675,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
1676,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
1677,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
1678,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
1679,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
1680,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
1681,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
1682,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
1683,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
1684,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
1685,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
1686,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
1687,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
1688,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
1689,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
1690,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
1691,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
1692,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
1693,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
1694,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
1695,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
1696,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
1697,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
1698,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
1699,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
1700,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
1701,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
1702,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
1703,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
1704,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
1705,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
1706,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
1707,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
1708,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
1709,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
1710,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
1711,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
1712,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
1713,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
1714,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
1715,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
1716,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
1717,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
1718,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
1719,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
1720,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
1721,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
1722,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
1723,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
1724,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
1725,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
1726,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
1727,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
1728,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
1729,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
1730,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
1731,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
1732,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
1733,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
1734,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
1735,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
1736,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
1737,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
1738,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
1739,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
1740,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
1741,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
1742,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
1743,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
1744,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
1745,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
1746,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
1747,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
1748,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
1749,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
1750,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
1751,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
1752,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
1753,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
1754,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
1755,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
1756,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
1757,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
1758,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
1759,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
1760,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
1761,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
1762,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
1763,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
1764,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
1765,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
1766,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
1767,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
1768,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
1769,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
1770,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
1771,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
1772,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
1773,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
1774,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
1775,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
1776,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
1777,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
1778,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
1779,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
1780,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
1781,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
1782,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
1783,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
1784,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
1785,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
1786,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
1787,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
1788,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
1789,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
1790,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
1791,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
1792,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
1793,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
1794,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
1795,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
1796,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
1797,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
1798,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
1799,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
1800,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
1801,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
1802,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
1803,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
1804,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
1805,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
1806,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
1807,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
1808,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
1809,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
1810,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
1811,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
1812,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
1813,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
1814,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
1815,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
1816,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
1817,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
1818,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
1819,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
1820,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
1821,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
1822,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
1823,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
1824,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
1825,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
1826,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
1827,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
1828,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
1829,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
1830,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
1831,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
1832,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
1833,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
1834,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
1835,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
1836,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
1837,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
1838,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
1839,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
1840,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
1841,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
1842,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
1843,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
1844,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
1845,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
1846,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
1847,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
1848,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
1849,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
1850,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
1851,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
1852,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
1853,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
1854,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
1855,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
1856,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
1857,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
1858,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
1859,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
1860,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
1861,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
1862,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
1863,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
1864,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
1865,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
1866,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
1867,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
1868,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
1869,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
1870,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
1871,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
1872,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
1873,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
1874,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
1875,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
1876,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
1877,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
1878,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
1879,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
1880,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
1881,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
1882,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
1883,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
1884,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
1885,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
1886,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
1887,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
1888,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
1889,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
1890,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
1891,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
1892,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
1893,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
1894,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
1895,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
1896,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
1897,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
1898,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
1899,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
1900,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
1901,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
1902,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
1903,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
1904,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
1905,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
1906,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
1907,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
1908,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
1909,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
1910,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
1911,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
1912,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
1913,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
1914,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
1915,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
1916,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
1917,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
1918,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
1919,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
1920,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
1921,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
1922,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
1923,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
1924,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
1925,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
1926,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
1927,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
1928,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
1929,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
1930,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
1931,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
1932,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
1933,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
1934,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
1935,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
1936,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
1937,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
1938,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
1939,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
1940,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
1941,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
1942,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
1943,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
1944,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
1945,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
1946,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
1947,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
1948,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
1949,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
1950,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
1951,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
1952,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
1953,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
1954,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
1955,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
1956,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
1957,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
1958,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
1959,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
1960,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
1961,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
1962,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
1963,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
1964,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
1965,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
1966,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
1967,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
1968,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
1969,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
1970,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
1971,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
1972,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
1973,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
1974,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
1975,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
1976,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
1977,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
1978,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
1979,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
1980,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
1981,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
1982,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
1983,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
1984,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
1985,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
1986,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
1987,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
1988,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
1989,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
1990,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
1991,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
1992,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
1993,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
1994,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
1995,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
1996,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
1997,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
1998,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
1999,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
2000,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
2001,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
2002,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
2003,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
2004,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
2005,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
2006,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
2007,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
2008,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
2009,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
2010,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
2011,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
2012,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
2013,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
2014,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
2015,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
2016,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
2017,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
2018,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
2019,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
2020,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
2021,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
2022,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
2023,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
2024,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
2025,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
2026,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
2027,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
2028,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
2029,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
2030,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
2031,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
2032,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
2033,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
2034,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
2035,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
2036,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
2037,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
2038,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
2039,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
2040,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
2041,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
2042,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
2043,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
2044,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
2045,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
2046,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
2047,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
2048,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
2049,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
2050,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
2051,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
2052,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
2053,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
2054,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
2055,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
2056,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
2057,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
2058,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
2059,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
2060,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
2061,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
2062,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
2063,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
2064,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
2065,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
2066,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
2067,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
2068,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
2069,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
2070,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
2071,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
2072,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
2073,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
2074,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
2075,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
2076,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
2077,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
2078,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
2079,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
2080,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
2081,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
2082,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
2083,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
2084,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
2085,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
2086,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
2087,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
2088,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
2089,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
2090,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
2091,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
2092,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
2093,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
2094,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
2095,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
2096,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
2097,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
2098,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
2099,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
2100,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
2101,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
2102,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
2103,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
2104,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
2105,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
2106,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
2107,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
2108,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
2109,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
2110,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
2111,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
2112,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
2113,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
2114,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
2115,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
2116,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
2117,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
2118,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
2119,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
2120,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
2121,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
2122,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
2123,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
2124,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
2125,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
2126,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
2127,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
2128,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
2129,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
2130,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
2131,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
2132,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
2133,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
2134,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
2135,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
2136,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
2137,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
2138,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
2139,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
2140,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
2141,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
2142,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
2143,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
2144,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
2145,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
2146,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
2147,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
2148,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
2149,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
2150,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
2151,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
2152,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
2153,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
2154,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
2155,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
2156,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
2157,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
2158,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
2159,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
2160,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
2161,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
2162,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
2163,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
2164,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
2165,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
2166,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
2167,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
2168,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
2169,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
2170,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
2171,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
2172,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
2173,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
2174,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
2175,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
2176,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
2177,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
2178,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
2179,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
2180,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
2181,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
2182,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
2183,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
2184,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
2185,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
2186,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
2187,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
2188,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
2189,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
2190,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
2191,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
2192,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
2193,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
2194,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
2195,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
2196,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
2197,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
2198,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
2199,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
2200,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
2201,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
2202,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
2203,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
2204,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
2205,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
2206,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
2207,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
2208,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
2209,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
2210,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
2211,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
2212,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
2213,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
2214,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
2215,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
2216,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
2217,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
2218,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
2219,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
2220,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
2221,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
2222,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
2223,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
2224,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
2225,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
2226,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
2227,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
2228,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
2229,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
2230,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
2231,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
2232,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
2233,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
2234,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
2235,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
2236,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
2237,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
2238,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
2239,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
2240,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
2241,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
2242,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
2243,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
2244,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
2245,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
2246,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
2247,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
2248,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
2249,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
2250,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
2251,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
2252,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
2253,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
2254,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
2255,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
2256,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
2257,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
2258,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
2259,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
2260,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
2261,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
2262,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
2263,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
2264,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
2265,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
2266,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
2267,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
2268,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
2269,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
2270,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
2271,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
2272,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
2273,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
2274,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
2275,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
2276,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
2277,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
2278,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
2279,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
2280,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
2281,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
2282,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
2283,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
2284,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
2285,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
2286,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
2287,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
2288,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
2289,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
2290,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
2291,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
2292,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
2293,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
2294,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
2295,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
2296,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
2297,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
2298,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
2299,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
2300,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
2301,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
2302,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
2303,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
2304,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
2305,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
2306,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
2307,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
2308,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
2309,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
2310,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
2311,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
2312,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
2313,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
2314,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
2315,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
2316,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
2317,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
2318,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
2319,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
2320,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
2321,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
2322,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
2323,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
2324,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
2325,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
2326,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
2327,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
2328,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
2329,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
2330,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
2331,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
2332,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
2333,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
2334,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
2335,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
2336,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
2337,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
2338,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
2339,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
2340,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
2341,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
2342,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
2343,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
2344,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
2345,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
2346,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
2347,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
2348,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
2349,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
2350,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
2351,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
2352,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
2353,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
2354,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
2355,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
2356,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
2357,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
2358,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
2359,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
2360,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
2361,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
2362,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
2363,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
2364,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
2365,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
2366,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
2367,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
2368,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
2369,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
2370,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
2371,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
2372,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
2373,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
2374,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
2375,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
2376,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
2377,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
2378,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
2379,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
2380,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
2381,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
2382,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
2383,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
2384,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
2385,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
2386,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
2387,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
2388,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
2389,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
2390,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
2391,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
2392,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
2393,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
2394,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
2395,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
2396,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
2397,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
2398,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
2399,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
2400,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
2401,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
2402,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
2403,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
2404,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
2405,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
2406,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
2407,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
2408,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
2409,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
2410,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
2411,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
2412,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
2413,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
2414,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
2415,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
2416,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
2417,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
2418,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
2419,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
2420,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
2421,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
2422,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
2423,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
2424,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
2425,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
2426,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
2427,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
2428,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
2429,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
2430,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
2431,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
2432,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
2433,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
2434,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
2435,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
2436,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
2437,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
2438,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
2439,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
2440,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
2441,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
2442,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
2443,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
2444,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
2445,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
2446,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
2447,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
2448,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
2449,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
2450,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
2451,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
2452,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
2453,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
2454,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
2455,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
2456,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
2457,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
2458,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
2459,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
2460,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
2461,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
2462,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
2463,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
2464,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
2465,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
2466,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
2467,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
2468,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
2469,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
2470,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
2471,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
2472,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
2473,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
2474,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
2475,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
2476,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
2477,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
2478,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
2479,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
2480,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
2481,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
2482,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
2483,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
2484,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
2485,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
2486,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
2487,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
2488,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
2489,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
2490,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
2491,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
2492,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
2493,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
2494,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
2495,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
2496,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
2497,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
2498,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
2499,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
2500,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
2501,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
2502,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
2503,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
2504,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
2505,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
2506,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
2507,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
2508,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
2509,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
2510,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
2511,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
2512,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
2513,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
2514,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
2515,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
2516,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
2517,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
2518,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
2519,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
2520,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
2521,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
2522,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
2523,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
2524,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
2525,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
2526,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
2527,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
2528,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
2529,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
2530,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
2531,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
2532,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
2533,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
2534,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
2535,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
2536,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
2537,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
2538,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
2539,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
2540,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
2541,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
2542,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
2543,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
2544,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
2545,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
2546,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
2547,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
2548,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
2549,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
2550,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
2551,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
2552,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
2553,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
2554,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
2555,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
2556,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
2557,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
2558,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
2559,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
2560,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
2561,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
2562,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
2563,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
2564,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
2565,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
2566,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
2567,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
2568,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
2569,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
2570,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
2571,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
2572,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
2573,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
2574,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
2575,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
2576,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
2577,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
2578,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
2579,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
2580,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
2581,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
2582,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
2583,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
2584,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
2585,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
2586,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
2587,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
2588,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
2589,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
2590,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
2591,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
2592,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
2593,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
2594,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
2595,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
2596,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
2597,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
2598,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
2599,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
2600,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
2601,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
2602,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
2603,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
2604,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
2605,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
2606,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
2607,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
2608,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
2609,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
2610,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
2611,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
2612,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
2613,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
2614,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
2615,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
2616,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
2617,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
2618,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
2619,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
2620,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
2621,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
2622,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
2623,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
2624,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
2625,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
2626,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
2627,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
2628,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
2629,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
2630,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
2631,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
2632,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
2633,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
2634,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
2635,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
2636,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
2637,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
2638,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
2639,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
2640,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
2641,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
2642,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
2643,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
2644,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
2645,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
2646,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
2647,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
2648,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
2649,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
2650,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
2651,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
2652,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
2653,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
2654,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
2655,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
2656,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
2657,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
2658,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
2659,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
2660,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
2661,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
2662,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
2663,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
2664,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
2665,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
2666,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
2667,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
2668,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
2669,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
2670,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
2671,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
2672,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
2673,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
2674,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
2675,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
2676,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
2677,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
2678,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
2679,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
2680,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
2681,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
2682,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
2683,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
2684,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
2685,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
2686,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
2687,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
2688,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
2689,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
2690,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
2691,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
2692,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
2693,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
2694,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
2695,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
2696,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
2697,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
2698,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
2699,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
2700,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
2701,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
2702,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
2703,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
2704,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
2705,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
2706,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
2707,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
2708,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
2709,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
2710,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
2711,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
2712,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
2713,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
2714,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
2715,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
2716,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
2717,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
2718,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
2719,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
2720,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
2721,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
2722,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
2723,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
2724,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
2725,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
2726,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
2727,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
2728,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
2729,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
2730,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
2731,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
2732,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
2733,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
2734,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
2735,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
2736,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
2737,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
2738,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
2739,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
2740,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
2741,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
2742,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
2743,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
2744,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
2745,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
2746,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
2747,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
2748,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
2749,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
2750,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
2751,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
2752,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
2753,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
2754,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
2755,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
2756,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
2757,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
2758,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
2759,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
2760,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
2761,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
2762,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
2763,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
2764,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
2765,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
2766,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
2767,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
2768,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
2769,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
2770,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
2771,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
2772,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
2773,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
2774,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
2775,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
2776,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
2777,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
2778,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
2779,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
2780,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
2781,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
2782,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
2783,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
2784,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
2785,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
2786,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
2787,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
2788,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
2789,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
2790,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
2791,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
2792,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
2793,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
2794,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
2795,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
2796,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
2797,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
2798,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
2799,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
2800,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
2801,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
2802,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
2803,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
2804,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
2805,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
2806,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
2807,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
2808,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
2809,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
2810,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
2811,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
2812,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
2813,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
2814,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
2815,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
2816,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
2817,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
2818,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
2819,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
2820,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
2821,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
2822,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
2823,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
2824,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
2825,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
2826,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
2827,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
2828,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
2829,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
2830,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
2831,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
2832,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
2833,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
2834,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
2835,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
2836,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
2837,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
2838,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
2839,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
2840,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
2841,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
2842,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
2843,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
2844,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
2845,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
2846,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
2847,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
2848,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
2849,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
2850,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
2851,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
2852,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
2853,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
2854,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
2855,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
2856,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
2857,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
2858,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
2859,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
2860,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
2861,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
2862,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
2863,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
2864,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
2865,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
2866,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
2867,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
2868,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
2869,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
2870,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
2871,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
2872,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
2873,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
2874,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
2875,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
2876,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
2877,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
2878,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
2879,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
2880,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
2881,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
2882,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
2883,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
2884,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
2885,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
2886,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
2887,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
2888,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
2889,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
2890,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
2891,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
2892,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
2893,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
2894,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
2895,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
2896,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
2897,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
2898,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
2899,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
2900,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
2901,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
2902,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
2903,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
2904,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
2905,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
2906,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
2907,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
2908,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
2909,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
2910,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
2911,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
2912,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
2913,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
2914,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
2915,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
2916,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
2917,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
2918,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
2919,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
2920,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
2921,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
2922,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
2923,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
2924,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
2925,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
2926,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
2927,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
2928,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
2929,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
2930,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
2931,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
2932,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
2933,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
2934,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
2935,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
2936,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
2937,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
2938,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
2939,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
2940,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
2941,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
2942,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
2943,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
2944,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
2945,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
2946,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
2947,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
2948,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
2949,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
2950,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
2951,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
2952,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
2953,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
2954,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
2955,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
2956,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
2957,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
2958,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
2959,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
2960,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
2961,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
2962,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
2963,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
2964,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
2965,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
2966,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
2967,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
2968,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
2969,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
2970,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
2971,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
2972,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
2973,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
2974,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
2975,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
2976,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
2977,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
2978,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
2979,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
2980,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
2981,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
2982,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
2983,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
2984,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
2985,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
2986,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
2987,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
2988,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
2989,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
2990,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
2991,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
2992,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
2993,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
2994,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
2995,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
2996,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
2997,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
2998,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
2999,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
3000,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
3001,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
3002,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
3003,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
3004,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
3005,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
3006,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
3007,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
3008,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
3009,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
3010,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
3011,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
3012,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
3013,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
3014,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
3015,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
3016,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
3017,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
3018,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
3019,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
3020,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
3021,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
3022,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
3023,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
3024,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
3025,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
3026,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
3027,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
3028,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
3029,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
3030,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
3031,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
3032,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
3033,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
3034,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
3035,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
3036,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
3037,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
3038,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
3039,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
3040,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
3041,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
3042,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
3043,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
3044,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
3045,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
3046,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
3047,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
3048,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
3049,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
3050,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
3051,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
3052,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
3053,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
3054,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
3055,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
3056,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
3057,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
3058,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
3059,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
3060,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
3061,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
3062,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
3063,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
3064,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
3065,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
3066,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
3067,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
3068,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
3069,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
3070,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
3071,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
3072,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
3073,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
3074,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
3075,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
3076,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
3077,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
3078,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
3079,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
3080,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
3081,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
3082,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
3083,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
3084,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
3085,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
3086,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
3087,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
3088,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
3089,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
3090,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
3091,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
3092,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
3093,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
3094,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
3095,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
3096,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
3097,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
3098,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
3099,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
3100,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
3101,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
3102,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
3103,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
3104,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
3105,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
3106,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
3107,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
3108,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
3109,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
3110,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
3111,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
3112,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
3113,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
3114,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
3115,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
3116,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
3117,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
3118,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
3119,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
3120,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
3121,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
3122,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
3123,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
3124,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
3125,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
3126,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
3127,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
3128,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
3129,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
3130,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
3131,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
3132,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
3133,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
3134,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
3135,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
3136,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
3137,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
3138,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
3139,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
3140,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
3141,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
3142,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
3143,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
3144,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
3145,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
3146,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
3147,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
3148,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
3149,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
3150,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
3151,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
3152,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
3153,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
3154,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
3155,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
3156,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
3157,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
3158,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
3159,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
3160,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
3161,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
3162,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
3163,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
3164,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
3165,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
3166,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
3167,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
3168,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
3169,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
3170,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
3171,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
3172,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
3173,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
3174,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
3175,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
3176,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
3177,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
3178,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
3179,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
3180,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
3181,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
3182,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
3183,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
3184,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
3185,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
3186,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
3187,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
3188,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
3189,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
3190,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
3191,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
3192,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
3193,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
3194,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
3195,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
3196,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
3197,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
3198,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
3199,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
3200,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
3201,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
3202,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
3203,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
3204,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
3205,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
3206,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
3207,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
3208,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
3209,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
3210,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
3211,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
3212,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
3213,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
3214,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
3215,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
3216,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
3217,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
3218,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
3219,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
3220,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
3221,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
3222,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
3223,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
3224,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
3225,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
3226,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
3227,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
3228,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
3229,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
3230,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
3231,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
3232,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
3233,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
3234,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
3235,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
3236,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
3237,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
3238,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
3239,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
3240,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
3241,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
3242,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
3243,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
3244,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
3245,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
3246,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
3247,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
3248,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
3249,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
3250,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
3251,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
3252,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
3253,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
3254,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
3255,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
3256,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
3257,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
3258,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
3259,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
3260,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
3261,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
3262,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
3263,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
3264,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
3265,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
3266,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
3267,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
3268,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
3269,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
3270,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
3271,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
3272,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
3273,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
3274,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
3275,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
3276,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
3277,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
3278,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
3279,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
3280,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
3281,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
3282,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
3283,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
3284,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
3285,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
3286,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
3287,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
3288,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
3289,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
3290,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
3291,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
3292,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
3293,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
3294,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
3295,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
3296,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
3297,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
3298,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
3299,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
3300,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
3301,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
3302,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
3303,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
3304,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
3305,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
3306,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
3307,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
3308,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
3309,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
3310,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
3311,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
3312,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
3313,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
3314,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
3315,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
3316,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
3317,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
3318,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
3319,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
3320,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
3321,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
3322,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
3323,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
3324,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
3325,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
3326,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
3327,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
3328,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
3329,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
3330,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
3331,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
3332,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
3333,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
3334,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
3335,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
3336,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
3337,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
3338,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
3339,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
3340,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
3341,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
3342,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
3343,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
3344,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
3345,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
3346,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
3347,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
3348,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
3349,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
3350,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
3351,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
3352,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
3353,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
3354,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
3355,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
3356,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
3357,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
3358,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
3359,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
3360,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
3361,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
3362,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
3363,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
3364,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
3365,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
3366,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
3367,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
3368,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
3369,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
3370,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
3371,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
3372,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
3373,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
3374,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
3375,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
3376,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
3377,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
3378,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
3379,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
3380,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
3381,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
3382,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
3383,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
3384,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
3385,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
3386,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
3387,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
3388,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
3389,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
3390,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
3391,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
3392,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
3393,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
3394,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
3395,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
3396,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
3397,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
3398,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
3399,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
3400,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
3401,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
3402,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
3403,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
3404,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
3405,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
3406,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
3407,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
3408,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
3409,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
3410,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
3411,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
3412,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
3413,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
3414,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
3415,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
3416,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
3417,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
3418,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
3419,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
3420,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
3421,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
3422,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
3423,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
3424,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
3425,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
3426,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
3427,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
3428,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
3429,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
3430,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
3431,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
3432,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
3433,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
3434,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
3435,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
3436,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
3437,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
3438,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
3439,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
3440,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
3441,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
3442,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
3443,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
3444,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
3445,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
3446,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
3447,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
3448,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
3449,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
3450,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
3451,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
3452,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
3453,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
3454,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
3455,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
3456,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
3457,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
3458,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
3459,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
3460,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
3461,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
3462,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
3463,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
3464,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
3465,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
3466,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
3467,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
3468,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
3469,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
3470,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
3471,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
3472,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
3473,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
3474,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
3475,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
3476,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
3477,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
3478,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
3479,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
3480,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
3481,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
3482,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
3483,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
3484,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
3485,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
3486,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
3487,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
3488,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
3489,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
3490,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
3491,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
3492,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
3493,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
3494,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
3495,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
3496,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
3497,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
3498,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
3499,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
3500,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
3501,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
3502,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
3503,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
3504,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
3505,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
3506,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
3507,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
3508,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
3509,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
3510,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
3511,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
3512,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
3513,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
3514,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
3515,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
3516,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
3517,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
3518,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
3519,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
3520,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
3521,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
3522,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
3523,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
3524,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
3525,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
3526,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
3527,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
3528,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
3529,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
3530,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
3531,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
3532,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
3533,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
3534,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
3535,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
3536,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
3537,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
3538,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
3539,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
3540,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
3541,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
3542,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
3543,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
3544,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
3545,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
3546,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
3547,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
3548,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
3549,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
3550,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
3551,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
3552,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
3553,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
3554,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
3555,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
3556,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
3557,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
3558,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
3559,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
3560,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
3561,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
3562,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
3563,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
3564,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
3565,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
3566,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
3567,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
3568,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
3569,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
3570,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
3571,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
3572,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
3573,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
3574,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
3575,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
3576,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
3577,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
3578,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
3579,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
3580,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
3581,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
3582,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
3583,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
3584,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
3585,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
3586,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
3587,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
3588,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
3589,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
3590,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
3591,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
3592,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
3593,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
3594,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
3595,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
3596,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
3597,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
3598,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
3599,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
3600,"The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution."
3601,"Had to cancel my flight months in advance due to a change of schedule. I was flying with American Airlines and British Airways. Selected seats and when I attempted to get a refund on the selected seats, AA refunded me with no issue when BA refused despite both companies having similar policies. Avoid them, fly with anyone else. Customer service is a joke, taking over 2 weeks to respond to my email and giving me no further justification than what I was told on the phone."
3602,"Flight cancelled with no reason given less than 24 h before departure. The earliest offered replacement on their (terrible to use) app was 3 days later, which was unacceptable. Their phone lines do not work and would reject your call due to being overwhelmed. Even submitting a claim on their website is frustrating due to their terrible interface. Overall, terrible company with wholly inadequate customer service."
3603,"This is a route I fly regularly. Used first class security and lounge all good. Lounge surprisingly not so busy. Was great to see we weren't departing from the dreaded A10 bus gate, and the flight was on time. Boarded and ready to go on time and then.... Six passengers were a no show. A 50 minute delay to offload the bags and depart, longer than the actual flight itself. There has to be a better process for fast tracking this. Hence finally arrived in Paris 45 mins late. On the plus side the cabin crew were great and even had a personal welcome from the inflight manager which happens less and less these days."
3604,"While BA may have made some positive improvements to its Club World product, its World Traveler product and catering leaves much to be desired. The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks. However, the poor level of catering made for a very frustrating trip. I certainly cannot recommend BA."
3605,"British Airways new Club Suite is a marked improvement from their older Club World seats. The new Club Suite offers a fair amount of privacy, especially with the screen door closed, and includes direct aisle access. When fully reclined, the seat converts into a fairly spacious bed, although I found the surface on the side a bit hard and uncomfortable to sleep on. The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive. This was a very frustrating end to what was otherwise a fairly enjoyable trip in Club World, and left a very poor last impression of BA."
3606,"Four very pleasant, on time flights with friendly, helpful staff. The guy on the LHR/SFO leg was exceptional and I regret that I have forgotten his name. Only negative was the food on the SFO/LHR leg. The advertised filet steak was more akin to stewing steak and was inedible. Sadly this is not the only occasion I have food on US/UK flights to be sub standard. Otherwise happy to recommend BA."
3607,"We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight"
3608,"Flight delayed an hour due to bad weather around JFK however this was made up during the flight, only to be delayed again by weather over LHR. Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight. A small but very valued touch that is often missing with business class flight attendants on BA. Very good experience all round except the price which is reflected in my value for money rating."
3609,A very full flight made Premium Economy feel a little less premium than you should expect for the price however the smaller cabin configuration and slightly roomier seating made the journey relaxing enough. Catering was pretty good and the inflight service was efficient and friendly. Arrived on time and no delays with baggage delivery. No complaints as PE served it's function for the relatively short 7.5hr flight.
3610,"The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!"
3611,"I am surprised to be able to give a favourable review of the flight. European Business Class is typically 3x3 seating with the middle seat on each group of three left empty. Leg room is never generous and BA is at the bottom of the generous barrel in this respect. However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them. It all tasted great, I didn't try the chocolate cake, and there was just about enough time to eat it before landing. The crew worked very hard to complete service in time so well done them."
3612,"Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays. The flight itself was quite good as was the cabin crew and the meal service."
3613,"BA cancelled the flight from Tokyo to LHR. I was booked on next day flight. There was another flight on the same day. I went to the desk, but the flight was full. BA in charge offers another flight through Hong Kong which would have been 26h flight time. I declined that, and asked to stay on the next day flight. To my dismay he cancelled the next day flight without telling me he did that. I think he was annoyed that I didn’t accept the offer after he spent sometime looking for. In fact I am the one who should be annoyed for cancelling my flight. I ended up flying another airline with downgrading. Poor service, and appalling behaviour. You expect better from BA."
3614,"I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA."
3615,"My partner and I were on the BA2166 return flight from Tampa to Gatwick and I was very excited as had paid for a upgrade to Business Class, my partner flies BC with BA a lot for work but this was only my second time, we decided as it was the end of our holiday that have this will help us get some quality sleep. Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off. What with that and how the checking in ground staff were treating us as if we were an inconvenience we will rethink BA moving forward."
3616,"We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title ""we've not forgotten your case"" and ""We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon."" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right. I have been a member of their Flying Club for 20 years, is this how you treat loyal customers BA?"
3617,"I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!"
3618,"We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced."
3619,"I sat in the plane at Vienna airport for three hours and didn't take off. After arriving in London, I was sent on my connecting flight, only to be told that the plane had already closed and that I should go back to the other terminal. I was then flown to Johannesburg with Virgin and when I arrived my luggage had not been taken. I only received it five days later. I have been waiting for compensation for nine months. Never again British Airways"
3620,It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.
3621,"I booked a long haul flight to Singapore with British Airways because I thought I could rely on them to provide good and reliable service. Unfortunately this wasn't the case hence this review. Knowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed. I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and £22. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is. Their cabin crew seemed overworked and overwhelmed and even when you pressed the attention buzzer no one came. If you can avoid booking with BA go ahead."
3622,"A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience. Very disappointing."
3623,Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines.
3624,"Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
3625,"LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
3626,I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
3627,"Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
3628,"BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
3629,"I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible."
3630,"Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
3631,I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
3632,"Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view."
3633,"Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
3634,"Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually!"
3635,"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
3636,"We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
3637,"The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
3638,British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
3639,"I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
3640,"Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
3641,"This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
3642,"Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
3643,"Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
3644,"We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
3645,"A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
3646,"Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
3647,"LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
3648,"Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
3649,Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
3650,"The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
3651,"We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
3652,"Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
3653,"Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
3654,"Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
3655,"Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
3656,"Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
3657,"BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
3658,"BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
3659,"The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
3660,"Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
3661,"I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back."
3662,"On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
3663,"I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
3664,"I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
3665,"Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
3666,"Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
3667,That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
3668,Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
3669,"We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
3670,"London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
3671,"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
3672,"I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
3673,"Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
3674,"On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
3675,"I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels."
3676,"We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
3677,"I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
3678,"I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
3679,"I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
3680,"Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked."
3681,Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
3682,"BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
3683,"Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
3684,"I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
3685,"I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
3686,"Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid."
3687,The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
3688,"Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
3689,"Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
3690,"As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!"
3691,First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
3692,"Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
3693,"My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company."
3694,"For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
3695,"Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
3696,"Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
3697,"This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
3698,"Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
3699,"Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
